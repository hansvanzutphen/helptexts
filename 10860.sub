UECP settings.

UECP is a standardized protocol that is used to send information to RDS encoders. It is supported by many software and hardware RDS encoders, and by many playout systems.

Originally, UECP was used over an RS232 connection, but many products are now supporting it via Tcp/IP. Stereo Tool only supports the latter.
