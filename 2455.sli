Perform Phase Rotation before all other filters.

By default, Phase Rotation is performed just before the clipper. If this setting
is enabled, it is moved to just before Natural Dynamics and the AGC.

At low latencies (1024 sampples and below), Phase Rotation is always done at the start of the processing chain.
