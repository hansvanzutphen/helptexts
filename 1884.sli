Filters out some high frequencies to protect processing against audio problems.

Some tracks from around 2010-2013 have a high pitched tone in them, which
causes compressors (not just in Stereo Tool but in nearly all audio
processors) to go haywire. If this setting is enabled, such frequencies
are filtered out before processing starts, which solves the problem.
