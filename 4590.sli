The maximum total bitrate of normal plus recovery packets.

Recovery packets can in some cases be a bit bigger than normal packets. So a few kbit/s overhead is
recommended. If no overhead is available above the (calculated) total bitrate based on normal plus
recovery packets, then any excess recovery packets are dropped.
