Size of the RMS detection area, when using RMS detection mode.

Using an RMS detection area slightly improves the standard RMS behavior. More importantly, it protects the compressor against
overreacting. If a loud sound stops, without using an RMS detection area, the compressor can keep moving down for a short
while. This is particularly noticeable on loud S sounds in higher bands - even after the S stops, the level drops down
further, and the audio after the S sounds dull. It takes a while for release to take over and increase the level again.

When using an RMS detection window, attack stops immediately after the loud sound and release takes over directly. In some
cases this can reduce unwanted drops of the highs after a loud S by more than 3 dB.
