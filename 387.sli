Ignore the declipping result if the output is still a flat line.

Declipping should increase the texture of what was a (clipped) straight line.
If not, the
samples that were detected as being clipped probably were not clipped in
the first place. So in that case, the result of the restoration should be
ignored and the original sample values should be used.
