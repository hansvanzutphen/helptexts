Disables the 2nd compressor if the attenuation didn't suddenly drop a lot.

The 2nd compressor should only be active if there's a huge difference between
the volume when using a normal and very fast attack, but that's not all - if
you play very dynamic music it should not kill the punch.
This slider controls how much the attenuation must have suddenly dropped (in
the fast attack 2nd compressor) for it to be taken into account.
