Settings to detect input tilt.

Input tilt can be caused by an analog path to Stereo Tool, but there are also
many CD's which contain clipped and then tilted audio.

See also [[10168]] - this is where you should fix a constant tilt in the input to Stereo Tool, which also improves the audio quality. The detection in this panel only detects the tilt but does not restore it.
