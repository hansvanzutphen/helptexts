Dynamically adjust the Dehummer behavior based on the input.

Note: This is not necessarily a good idea for good audio quality, it's more intended at forensics uses.
For example, if you want to filter out the sound of a driving car, which slowly changes in sound, it can
help to make the Dehummer learn continuously.

On music this will sound bad, so don't use it on that.
