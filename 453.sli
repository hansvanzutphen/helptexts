The amount of headroom.

If this value is too low, sudden big volume drops (red line) can occur,
which are usually visible as a sharp very deep spike down. This causes a
very brief drop in audio level, which must be inserted at that point because
otherwise the signal would have gotten above the [[425]].

However, if you lower this value, the average output level will also be
lower (of course, differences of 0.1 dB are not really noticeable).
