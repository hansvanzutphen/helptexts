Shows how many seconds the watermarking has worked since the last clock time reset.

This is useful to verify that watermarking is active, and to see when the watermarking clock time has been updated.
If the time doesn't move while this watermark is enabled, watermarking is not working - you should have received an error message at an earlier point if that's the case.

Always verify that the signal that you <i>think</i> you are watermarking is indeed running. For example, if you are feeding a left/right demodulated
FM signal to a streaming encoder, it may sound ok but it would have the FM watermark. In that case, no HD signal would be watermarked at all.
So, always verify that the output(s) that you expect to be watermarking are all enabled, and no others.
