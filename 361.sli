A sample may be clipped if it is above this level, but not below it.

This level is relative to the maximum peak level over a period of time,
and can be different at the top and the bottom of the waveform.

For CD input with clipping that has not been tilted, a value of 99% should
be used here - there is no such thing as 'maybe clipped' in that case.
