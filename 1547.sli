Lets certain frequencies be counted more than others by the AGC.

See for example this image:

As you can see, low bass frequencies are ignored. This means that in a track,
if suddenly the bass kicks in, the level is hardly adjusted. Similarly,
frequencies between 600 and 2000 Hz are counted a lot less strongly, which
helps to keep the level constant for loud female voices. This avoids
pumping.
