Sets the L-R level boost when the AGC is not active.

If the AGC drops below the threshold level, that would also turn any
stereo increase off. This setting can be used to set the "baseline"
stereo increment when the AGC is inactive.

When the AGC is active (for both L+R and L-R), this setting has no effect.
