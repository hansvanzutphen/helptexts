Does not declip if the samples above and below the clipping level look different.

If a sound is clipped and then noise is added (analog audio path, tilt,
MP3 encoding), then when looking at the histogram it should normally look
roughly symmetrical above and below the clipping level. If that's not the
case, it may be an indicaton that clipping was detected incorrectly.
