Determines how strongly the L+R signal is added to the L-R signal.

Adding the L+R (which is normally stronger) to the L-R signal gives a more natural
control of the amount of stereo than just setting a maximum difference between the
levels would.

Set it higher to get less of a stereo boost. At 0, the stereo boost is maximum
(L-R in the output is equal to L+R in level).
