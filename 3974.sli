Disables reconstruction of very high frequencies.

The Spectral Hole Filler is good at reconstructing small gaps in the audio, but less good at 
reconstructing large areas. In many cases, in lower bitrate MP3/MPEG2 encoded files a lot of 
high frequency content is removed. If the Spectral Hole Filler reconstructs this audio it
can sound weird.

A better solution is to use Spectral Hole Filler in combination with [[10898]] - a link
between the two still needs to be made...
