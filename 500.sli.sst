Selects the sample rate to use for audio input.Normally, the output sample rate will be identical to the input sample rate. The only exception is when you are not using ASIO, the sample rate is lower than 128 kHz, and FM output is used.In this case, if you use sample rates above 48 kHz, the audio will be downsampled before processing and upsampled again afterwards. 88.2 and 176.4 kHz are downsampled to 44.1 kHz, 96 and 192 kHz are downsampled to 48 kHz.The sample rate has a small effect on the latency and CPU load. At 48 kHz there is a bit more data that needs to be processed, which slightly increases the CPU load. The latency is a bit smaller because a block of the same number of samples is a bit smaller. &nbsp;If you use 32 kHz or a multiple thereof, the CPU load is a lot smaller - but you should only use this low a sample rate it if you don&#39;t need any audio output above approximately 14 kHz.If you want to use the FM output with stereo and RDS encoding, and you are using ASIO, then the sample rate must be set to at least 128 kHz. Samples rates of 176.4 or 192 kHz are preferred. If you don&#39;t use ASIO for the output, the output sound card will automatically be opened with a high enough sample rate to send out the stereo and RDS signals.Important: If you are not&nbsp;using ASIO, you need to make sure that the Windows sound card driver is configured to use the same sample rate that you have selected in Omnia SST, or Windows will resample it. This causes audible artifacts and may cause issues with the FM output (or it may not work at all). Open the properties for the audio card you are using and click on the &ldquo;Advanced&rdquo; tab. Set the &ldquo;Default Format&rdquo; to a mode with a sample rate that matches the one selected in SST.<hr style="page-break-before:always;display:none;">
