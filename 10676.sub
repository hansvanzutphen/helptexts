Controls the frequency range on which the stereo widener works.

Widening deep bass sounds is useless and may actually reduce the
reception quality. The human hearing cannot distinguish where bass
comes from (unless you're using headphones).

Widening high frequencies in combination with a delay may cause an echo-like effect.
Some people like this, others don't.
