Allows input of an external RDS generator signal. Internally, the pilot will be synchronized to the incoming RDS signal - any incoming pilot signal will be ignored. A poor quality or week RDS signal might result in problems, including the internal stereo pilot generator will take over. Those factors aside, the input level does not matter. This setting will be disabled if &ldquo;Use as backup&rdquo; is &ldquo;On&rdquo;.
