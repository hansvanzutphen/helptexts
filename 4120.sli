Sets the AGC input level.

Most of the included presets were built assuming that the input level for music typically peaks to about 0 dB.
Use the AGC drive to drive it harder that that.

If the input level to the sound card is too low, [[542]] should be used instead, since the input level shouldn't
really be part of a preset and also affects other things, such as [[10194]] and [[10206]].
