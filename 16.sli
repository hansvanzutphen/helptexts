Prepares the bass to be played on a system with a single subwoofer.

If there is a phase difference in the bass between the left and right channel, and the sound is played using a single bass speaker, the bass will get deformed and lowered in volume. If this filter is turned on, phase differences for bass sounds are removed completely, which solves this problem.
This occurs only very rarely. Note however that when the [[23]] slider is set to a high value, this will occur much more frequently.
When listening with headphones, this somewhat reduces the stereo effect.
