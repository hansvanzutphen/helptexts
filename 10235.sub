<b>DEPRECATED!</b> Clips the audio below 0 dB with little protection against distortion.

This filter is good at removing short spikes, but causes distortion if it needs to clip too much.

If the [[10236]] is enabled, this filter is in bypass mode, except that it amplifies the audio with the value set in the slider.
