ITU-BS.1770 loudness metering compliant mode.

ITU-BS.1770 is the base upon which the R128 loudness level metering has been
built. In ITU-BS.1770 mode, the AGC adjusts the level based on how human
hearing works, instead of the actual power of the audio. Bass
is counted less strong, and higher frequencies are counted stronger.
