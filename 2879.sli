Perform [[10699]] after the [[10194]].

If your material is clipped first and then noise/hum is added, for example if you play clipped CD's on a system that has a hum, the hum needs to be removed first, and declipper should be done afterwards. In that case, leave this setting off.

But, if for some reason the clipping happened after the noise/hum was added, then you can enable this setting to declip first, and remove the noise and hum afterwards.
