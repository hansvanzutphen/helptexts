Protection against sudden large level increments.

If - after a moment of silence, or after a longer very soft part of a song - the level
suddenly increases a lot, Sudden Jump Protection can very quickly turn the level down,
overriding the normal [[4874]] speed.

This makes the AGC output sound far more constant, and makes things a lot easier for
the processing that comes afterwards.
