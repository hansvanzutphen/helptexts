Text field to specify the [[117]] in more detail.

This can be used to transmit an 8-character PTYN text that will be displayed on receivers, usually instead of the
PTY code. For example, the PTY code, which needs to be selected from a (limited and sometimes outdated) list of
31 entries, might be SPORT. And the PTYN text could then be FOOTBALL.

Receivers will still filter based on the [[117]] value.
