Size of the RMS detection area.

Using an RMS detection area slightly improves the RMS behavior. More importantly, it protects the AGC against
overreacting. If a loud sound stops, without using an RMS detection area, the AGC can keep moving down for a short
while. The RMS detection area is used to detect overreactions and stop any movements in the wrong direction.
