The network interface on the pc to send the data to.

Typically, the operating system will automatically figure out to which network port data needs to be sent to
reach the target IP address. But in some cases - especially when using multiple internet providers or links
for redundancy - you might want to decide this yourself. If 2 internet providers are available that can both
reach the target IP address (or, multiple IP addresses that all point to the same target device), you can
decide which data is sent via which provider. The OS will probably choose the same provider for both streams,
which would remove much of the redundancy.
