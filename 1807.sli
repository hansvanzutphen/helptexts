Increases the level of the 2nd compressor with faster attack.

Because the attack is so much faster, the audio level of the 2nd compressor
is generally a bit lower. If we would take the minimum of the two, we would
always look at the 2nd compressor, but that should only happen in extreme
cases. By increasing the output level and then taking the maximum of the two,
the 2nd compressor only has an effect on the sound if its output level is
quite a bit lower. For example, if this value is set to 2.00, the 2nd compressor
will not kick in if the level difference is less than 6 dB.
