Shows how many seconds the watermarking has worked since the last clock time reset.

This is useful to verify that watermarking is active, and to see when the watermarking clock time has been updated.
If the time doesn't move while this watermark is enabled, watermarking is not working - you should have received an error message at an earlier point if that's the case.

Always verify that the signal that you <i>think</i> you are watermarking is indeed running.
