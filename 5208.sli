Selects how the Bass EQ works.

Either way, the high part of the band is never adjusted.

"Adjust relative to each other" means that the bass bands keep their level in total, but are adjusted
relative to each other.

"Adjust relative to band above active bands" means that both bands are adjusted to match the level
of the audio above the bass bands, without adjusting that highest band.
