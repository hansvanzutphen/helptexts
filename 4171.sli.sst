Under normal circumstances, the &ldquo;Hear&rdquo; and &ldquo;Delta&rdquo; buttons are always active so you can easily isolate processing stages and compare changes. &nbsp;But this means that they will affect the on-air signal if SST is in the program chain. &nbsp; &nbsp;To &nbsp;help prevent inadvertent mistakes after you are done tuning SST off line, &nbsp;place this control in the &ldquo;off&rdquo; position to disable all &ldquo;Hear&rdquo; and &ldquo;Delta&rdquo; functions. &nbsp;
