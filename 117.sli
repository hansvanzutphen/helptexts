The type of program that you're broadcasting.

Many receivers can automatically search for some type of broadcast, such
as a news broadcast. If you don't always broadcast the same type of
program and you want to update this setting, make sure that
[[118]] is enabled.

The list of PTY codes is very different for RDS (EBU, used in Europe) and
RDBS which is used in the US. The PTY codes are changed when you change
the [[111]].
