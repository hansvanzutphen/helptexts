Stream address, if [[9051]] is set to Stream (via VLC)

A valid address of a stream that VLC can decode. This requires that
<a href="http://www.videolan.org/vlc/">VLC</a> (32 bit version for 32 bit Stereo Tool, 64 bit version for 64 bit Stereo Tool) is installed on your system.
Currently only works in Windows.

If you have a problem with a stream, please try if you can open it in VLC Media Player directly.

If necessary you can supply extra VLC command line arguments after the URL. For example <tt>--extraintf logger -vvv</tt> will show a logging window that might be useful to find out what's happening exactly (do not turn this on during normal usage because it can make things unstable). Other options can be used to control sample rate, buffering and more. For a full list of options (some can cause big problems when using them from within Stereo Tool) see <a href="https://wiki.videolan.org/VLC_command-line_help">VLC command line help</a>.
