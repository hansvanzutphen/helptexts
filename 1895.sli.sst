Allows phase to be adjusted at specific frequencies. This can be useful to make more &ldquo;boomy&rdquo; bass sounds (for example), by emulating the nonlinearities found in certain analog processors. The horizontal axis of the graph is frequency, and the vertical axis is the amount of additional phase delay to be applied at that frequency. Curves can be modified by drawing them directly on the graph with the cursor.
