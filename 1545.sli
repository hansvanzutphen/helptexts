[Select how extensive the user interface is.]

With this pull-down menu you can choose how extensive (and hence complicated
to use) the user interface is.

if you want to load a preset and only change some simple things, use Simple.
For normal users, Basic should be fine. Advanced and Expert show a lot more
settings that are difficult to use and can easily ruin the sound. Extreme
Tweaker contains lots of obscure settings that you should probably never
touch.
