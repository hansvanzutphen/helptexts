Plays only the sounds that are determined to be pre-ringing.

If [[2785]] is enabled, the pre-ringing sound is played on the left
channel, and the audio on the right channel is unaffected. This makes
it easy to hear if only pre-ringing is removed (the sounds stop at the
moment when a kick is played), or more sounds are removed.
