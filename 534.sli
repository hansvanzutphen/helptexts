Controls how fast synchronization works

Synchronization is done by slightly changing the sample rate of the input
signal. This means that it has a (small) effect on the pitch of audio.
Using a faster speed means that synchronization works faster, but gets more
audible.

The default setting is 1%, which means that the <i>maximum</i> possible
adjustment if things are really wrong is 1%.
