Removes background noise, including 16-bit quantization noise.

The noise gate removes background noise, which is mainly useful for older
recordings. But even for recent CD's it helps to let it work very gently,
because quantization noise (the number of bits on a CD is not infinite)
can be increased a lot by processing which makes music sound harsh. Gentle
[[10083]] and [[10084]] solve this.
