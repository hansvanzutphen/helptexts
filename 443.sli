Selects between clean highs and constant volume levels.

High frequencies can get extremely loud due to FM [[110]]. With this slider,
you can choose if you want to keep the volume of all other sounds constant
(low values), or if you want loud highs to be able to push other frequencies
down. That allows the highs to sound brighter, but pumping caused by loud
highs is very annoying in music.

If you are using [[10519]], higher values are less problematic, because highs are less problematic.
