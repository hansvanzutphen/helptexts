Relative response speed to spectral increases in a band.

After the filter has increased level in a band, a loud sound might kick in which causes the filter to need to reduce it again. Sometimes, that correction might seem too abrupt. This control allows that downward correction to be slowed down and potentially sound more natural. Lower values correspond to slower downward correction.
