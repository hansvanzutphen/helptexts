Lowers the maximum MPX deviation when using BS.412.

If you have a sound card that's not perfectly linear, you can lower this
slider a bit to lower the maximum peak level of the output. The [[10117]]
will still be reached, so this can be used to protect against 75 kHz overshoots.

Stations that <i>want</i> to sound smashed can lower this setting further
to increase the amount of clipping.
