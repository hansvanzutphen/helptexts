Reduce bass further if it causes problems.

If [[394]] or [[449]] indicates that the bass is damaging other sounds,
by potentially causing intermodulation distortion, the bass clipping level
is reduced further, at most this level.

If this level is much lower than [[311]], the effect on the bass level may
become noticeable and annoying.
