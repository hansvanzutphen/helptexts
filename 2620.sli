If bass is present ([[2641]]), increases the [[2631]] temporarily.

This slider controls how strongly the bass affects the release behavior. Setting it higher means more release slowdown when we see bass.

If you use this for a single multiband band, then you need less of this because there are less other frequencies that hinder bass detection.
