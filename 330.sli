Determines whether Gating is based on the actual input level, or the input level after [[6]].

Controls the behavior of [[274]].

If this is enabled, the gating level is based on the input level, ignoring the setting of [[6]]. In other words, increasing [[6]] does not require changing the [[274]].

If this is disabled, gating just responds to the actual input volume of the AGC - if [[6]] is increased, the [[274]] also needs to be increased to get the same behavior as before.
