Clipper level.

For higher frequency bands, clipping typically gives a much nicer result than [[963]],
if the bands are narrow enough.
The clipper output is filtered afterwards to remove distortion, which results in a very tightly
controlled sound.

For low frequency bands, the filtering is not very effective and [[963]] should be used instead.
