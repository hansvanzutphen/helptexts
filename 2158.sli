Uses composite clipping mode for some preparation steps.

Before the actual clipping starts, a 'test' clip is performed to detect
quality issues such as drops in other frequencies caused by loud highs.
If this setting is disabled, this test clip is performed at a lower
sample rate, which might slightly affect the result of the measurement.
