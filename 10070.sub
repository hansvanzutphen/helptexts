Pre-emphasis settings.

To reduce hiss on the receiver, FM stations broadcast high frequencies
a lot louder, and the receiver reduces this again. If you don't configure
pre-emphasis correctly, you'll get a very dull sound that lacks highs.
So, if you don't hear enough highs on your FM station, this is where you
should look first.
