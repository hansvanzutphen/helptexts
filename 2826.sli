Controls how much effect punch (transient) detection has.

At 0%, everything is boosted maximally regardless of detection of punch.
At 100%, the amount of widening for constant tones appoaches none at all.

Setting this too high may reveal some unwanted effects and cause the total
effect of the stereo widener to be less than desirable.
