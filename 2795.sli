Automatically calls [[10440]] if an input or output does not work.

If no audio passes through a sound card input or output for over
10 seconds, if this setting is enabled [[10440]] is triggered automatically.

If after 4 restarts no audio has passed through it at all, Stereo Tool is
restarted completely if [[2796]] is also enabled.

Note that VLC inputs or outputs are not included in this (they might disappear
for longer periods due to network issues etc).
