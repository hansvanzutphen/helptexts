Downmix audio to mono for mono AM transmitters.

The downmixing is more sophisticated than traditional downmixing, because
any issues caused by phase differences between the channels (phase
cancellation) are solved. So to get the best sound, it's better to feed
Stereo Tool with stereo input and use this downmix switch than to feed
Stereo Tool with mono input.
