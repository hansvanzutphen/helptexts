If ASIO is enabled, selects which physical outputs to use on the selected ASIO device for the MPX outputs. These settings will override the &ldquo;Device ID&rdquo; setting, which is used to select a WDM device. Selecting &ldquo;No ASIO&rdquo; will disable ASIO for the output. In addition, &ldquo;ASIO Output Right/2&rdquo; is disabled when &ldquo;No ASIO&rdquo; is selected in &ldquo;ASIO Output Left/1&rdquo;.
