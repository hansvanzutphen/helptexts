Ignore the loudest few sample values for peak level measurement.

Due to several causes (MP3 encoding, analog input), sometimes a few samples
can peak above the clipping level. So it's safer to ignore the loudest few
samples. This slider controls how many of such loud samples should be ignored.

This is a long-term measurement, so the percentage of values to be ignored
should be equal to or lower than that for [[374]].
