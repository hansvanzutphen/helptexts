Determines how quickly a new delayed clip can occur.

A punchy sound means that the volume goes up suddenly. To determine whether
the volume goes up, we need to keep track of the average level - this value
tells the detection algorithm what the lowest frequency is that it can
expect in the input, which helps to determine how fast it should respond to
lower sample values.
