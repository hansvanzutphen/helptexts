Chooses between Analog and Digital compressor mode.

Analog mode was added later, and is the preferred mode. It sounds slightly better and it uses far less processing power.

For the first Multiband Compressor, you can choose whether you want to use Digital or Analog mode. [[10781]] only supports Analog mode.

<b>To keep this manual readable, the manual for the first Multiband Compressor (this one) will only describe the Digital parameters. For Analog mode, also for the first Multiband Compressor, see [[10781]].</b>
