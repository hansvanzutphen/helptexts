Removes FM stereo hiss on the input (!) signal.

If you need to rebroadcast audio from another radio station, and reception
is not optimal, this filter can remove the FM stereo hiss without touching
the rest of the sound. The sound stays stereo. Even quite severe stereo hiss
can be nearly completely removed.
