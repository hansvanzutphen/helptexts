Lowers the maximum MPX deviation when using BS412. If you have a sound card that&#39;s not perfectly linear, you can reduce this setting to lower the maximum peak level of the output. Essentially this control can be used to protect against 75 kHz overshoots with the BS412. Stations that want to sound very dense or &ldquo;smashed&rdquo; can lower this setting further to increase the amount of clipping.
