Clips bass harder if it's asymmetrical.

Asymmetrical bass (just like asymmetrical mids, which are handled by [[10231]]) are as bad for the sound as symmetrical bass sounds at half the frequency - meaning that they can easily cause very noticeable intermodulation distortion.
If this setting is checked, the detection of asymmetrical bass causes the bass clipping level to be lowered, which protects the other sounds.
