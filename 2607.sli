Language selection.

.stl (Stereo Tool Language) files must be placed in the same directory
where Stereo Tool is installed. You can find language files in the
<a href="http://forums.stereotool.com/viewforum.php?f=23&sid=93fcdda059c6fda5e9ea57e444fbd8e5">Language/Translation files section of the forum</a>.
In the future, they will be included in the Stereo Tool installation.
