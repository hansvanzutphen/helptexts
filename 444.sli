Avoids AGC level drops caused by loud female voices in songs.

In some tracks with really loud female voices (for example, many Celene
Dion songs), the AGC will lower the volume for loud notes, causing pumping.
This setting detects such sounds and lowers them before adjusting the level.

This has been superseded by the much more powerful [[10479]].
