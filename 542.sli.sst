Adjusts the input level to SST. Input metering should reach around 0 dB on peaks.Many facilities allow a lot of headroom in their signal path, with reference levels potentially as low as -24 dBFS for analog signals of +4 dBu. The factory presets in Omnia SST were designed for input levels around 0 dB on the input meters. With lower input levels than that, certain stages such as the declipper, noise removal, and AGC may not function as effectively as they can.Of course, it is still possible to accommodate lower input signal levels with a large amount of headroom. With this slider you can adjust the level such that under normal circumstances the peaks are at about 0 dB. If peaks are occasionally louder, that&#39;s no problem. Unlike some environments, the signal does not clip at 0 on the input metering.For best results, adjust the input gain of the soundcard mixer before&nbsp;adjusting this control. &nbsp;Setting gain stages is important in any system, and adding gain at this stage can potentially increase any noise introduced by the sound card.
