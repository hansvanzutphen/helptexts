Switches stereo enhancement off when the signal is nearly mono.

If the left and right channel levels are not perfectly equal, sounds such
as a DJ speaking through a microphone would constantly be moved off-center even more -
and if a delay ([[2802]]) is used, an echo would be audible all the time.
To protect against this, the filter switches off is the signal is nearly
mono.
