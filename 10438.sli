Fire up the sound card driver's ASIO control panel.

The ASIO control panel is a window provided by the sound card driver which
lets you configure certain things, such as the ASIO block size (which affects
latency).

If you want an as low as possible latency, find the lowest latency value here
that works without hiccups.

Not all sound card drivers support this button (although you can usually
change the settings elsewhere if they don't).
