If the volume suddenly increases by more than this amount, sudden burst protection is activated.

If you set this level too low, sudden burst protection will be activated too soon and there will be a loss of dynamics. If it's set too high, loud bursts will be let through to the next processing steps. You can see that loud burst protection is active in the output meters - when burst protection is used a piece of the meters gets a different color.
