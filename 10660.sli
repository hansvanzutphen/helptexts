FORCES A CRASH! Used to test watchdog and logging behavior.

Pressing this button will cause an exception in Stereo Tool that would
normally cause it to crash. This can be used to test if the logging works
(see description above) and if the [[2796]] behavior functions properly.

When this button is pressed, an attempt is made to write data to memory
position 0. You will see an exception with code 0xc0000005, read/write=1, r/w location=0x0.
