Ignore the declipping result if it did not increase the peak level enough.

Declipping should cause the peak level to increase a bit, otherwise the
samples that were detected as being clipped probably were not clipped in
the first place. So in that case, the result of the restoration should be
ignored and the original sample values should be used.
