This function protects against clicks and pops due to buffer underruns.When the ASIO buffer size is set very small (to minimize latency, for example) in some cases a block of audio may not yet be available when it needs to be sent to the ASIO driver, resulting in audible clicks.Enabling this setting lets Omnia SST anticipate the data that would be sent to the sound card and send that predicted data instead. This masks most of the clicks and pops, but occasional underruns may still occur.Turning this setting temporarily can help you determine the minimum acceptable buffer size before clicks start to occur. &nbsp;Once you determine this threshold, &nbsp;increase the buffer size slightly and re-enabling it the setting to give an additional margin of protection once the buffer size is set appropriately. &nbsp; For best results, keep this option enabled during normal (on-air) operation.
