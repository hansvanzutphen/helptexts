Scales Maximum bass peak level according to the predicted bass level coming out of the AGC and Multiband filters.

If this is disabled, the maximum bass peak level does not change if any other settings are changed. If it is enabled, the filter will make a prediction of the maximum bass level coming out of the AGC and Multiband filters, and assume that 100% is this maximum level (short bass spikes in Multiband are ignored in this calculation).
