The maximum amount of Immersive Bass that may be added, relative to what is already there.

Adding a lot of Immersive Bass to very clean deep bass sounds without any other sounds present to
mask the effect can sound weird and somewhat distorted. This setting limits how much may be added,
compared to the audio already present around the same frequency.

See also [[6342]], the maximum of these two is used.
