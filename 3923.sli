Amount of pre-ringing allowed.

Since the subharmonic frequency is lower, it can sometimes start before the original bass sound started. This sounds very strange. This setting determines how much pre-ringing is allowed. Setting it too low will also remove reconstructed bass harmonics if they are a lot louder than the original.
