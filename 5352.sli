Maximum noise level, added after MPEG compression.

The Spectral Hole Filler assumes that audio that has been thrown away by MPEG encoding is completely
silent. If the MPEG compressed audio is sent through an analog studio, for example, some noise might
be present, and this setting can be used to make the Spectral Hole Filler ignore that noise in its
determination of whether something is an MPEG compression artifact or not.
