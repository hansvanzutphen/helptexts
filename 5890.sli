Sets the detection frequency range for detecting potentially audible crackles.

The Sand Filter detects larger (typically a few thousand Hz)
areas in the spectrum with very little content that could
mask crackling sounds caused by Controlled Distortion, and
then protects those against the "sandy" (crackling) sound.
