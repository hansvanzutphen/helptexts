Switches between old and new mouse behavior for sliders.

The new mouse behavior makes the mouse work at a typically useful speed. You can hold Control or right-click when adjusting a slider setting to have very precise control, and you can use Shift to move faster, in bigger steps.

The old mouse behavior was quite different from how most programs work. Holding the left mouse key long switches to a mode where movements are slower.
