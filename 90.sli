Enabled or disables the multiband clipper.

When the volume of a band gets higher than the value set in [[35]], clipping can be used to cut off the sound that is too loud.

Using clipping improves the sound quality because very short very loud spikes that are left over after compressing or limiting are removed. This makes the sound far less "jumpy", and the output volume more constant.
