Bass enhancement effects.

Immersive Bass adds "warm", "car radio" bass.

True Bass adds deep subharmonics that are often missing on older recordings, that were optimized for vinyl releases.

The Bass Clipper controls the amount of bass that goes into the final clipper, and replaces peaks by some harmonics, that
can give the impression of more bass on small speakers.
