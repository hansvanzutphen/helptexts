Attempts repair of azimuth (phase) errors.Azimuth errors are often present in tape recordings, and also on poorly mastered CDs. Phase problems cause very unpleasant artifacts when playing a recording in mono or through a surround system. Even normal stereo playback may sometimes sound a bit &ldquo;odd&rdquo;. &nbsp;Any large phase offset is automatically detected and removed by this filter.This filter only works properly if audio on the left and right channels is similar. If this is not the case for a long period of time, the azimuth correction will slowly be reduced.
