Protects against drops in the lows/mids caused by very loud highs.

Very loud highs (which can easily occur due to pre-emphasis)
can push all other sounds down in level. This gives a very
annoying, restless effect.

Leif's high gap protection is the replacement of the older
Highs gap protection, which used far more CPU load to achieve
the same effect.
