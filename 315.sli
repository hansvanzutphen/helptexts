Controls hiss vs. tone detection.

A lower value means that sounds are more easily detected to be noise - a too low value will reduce not only stereo hiss but also other stereo sounds.

A higher value means that even hiss is not detected properly anymore, and noise removal will not work at all anymore.

Hint: Use the Difference checkbox to hear if what is removed is really only the stereo hiss.
