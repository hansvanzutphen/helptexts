Enables AVX2 hand-optimized code.

Many processing algorithms were optimized using hand-written SSE2 and AVX2 code. This setting enables
that code. Note that compiler-generated AVX2 code if not affected by this setting, it will be used
whenever the CPU supports it.

You should not touch this setting unless you have a very specific reason for it.
