Adjusts for different input levels on left and right channel.If the left and right channel input levels aren&#39;t perfectly equal (which might happen for example if you&#39;re using analog equipment), this slider allows you to correct it. A negative value means that the left channel is boosted, a positive value means that the right channel is boosted. &nbsp;A good way to calibrate balance is to input mono &nbsp;audio and adjust this slider until the input meter levels are visually equal for left and right.Most other devices (including amplifiers) may reduce the level of a channel instead of increasing it. The reason to increase the level is that otherwise it&#39;s more difficult to show both the original and the modified (by Input gain and Balance) volume levels - one channel could be made louder while the other could be made softer.
