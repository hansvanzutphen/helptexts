Faster synchronization after startup of after loss of signal.

During normal operation, the synchronization should be done very prudently.
But directly after connecting or reconnecting to a stream, to avoid taking
multiple hours to reach synchronization, it can be done a bit faster. Turbo
controls how fast the speed can be adjusted in this situation. Note that the
maximum amount of speedup is still controlled by [[536]], so if that is not
set too high it should still be nearly unnoticeable. The [[534]] effect
is increased in Turbo mode, so there is no big slowdown when the target point is reached.
