Turn this toggle on if the input is analog, or if it may have been been resampled.If the input is analog or resampled, the position in the audio where samples are taken &#39;moves&#39;, which makes it more difficult to distinguish between samples that are clipped and not clipped.When this toggle is on, if a sample is detected as clipped, the 2 surrounding samples will also be marked as clipped. This does mean that the set of &#39;good&#39; samples is reduced, which makes restoration a bit harder. But the opposite, not detecting a sample as clipped while it actually is clipped, is far less desirable.
