Shows the output before (left) and after (right) tilt correction.

Important: You need to make sure that there's enough headroom for the
tilt correction. So, if you feed a 15 Hz square wave, the waveform should
not clip. If it does, you need to lower the output level to the sound card
(and adjust the transmitter to handle the lower level).
