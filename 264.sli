Global CPU load control

Allows lowering the CPU load at the expense of a degradation in audio
quality. For every 10% the Quality slider is below 100%, the CPU load is
reduced by 5% - so at the lowest setting of 20% the CPU load is 60% of that
at Quality 100%.

At the maximum [[263]] setting, Quality has very little effect and a value
of around 50% is acceptable for most people. At lower [[263]] settings, the
effect on the audio (especially bass) is much bigger.
