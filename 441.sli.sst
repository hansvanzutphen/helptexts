Unlike most bass clippers, the one in Omnia SST can (but does not have to) create a square wave when processing strong low frequency content. Setting the &ldquo;Strength&rdquo; control at &ldquo;0&rdquo; (0%) will always prevent square waving the bass resulting in a very smooth low end texture, but one that does not offer the &ldquo;slam&rdquo; of a traditional Omnia clipper even on the initial peak of a bass transient waveform.
