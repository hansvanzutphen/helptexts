The amount of time that hiss detection uses.

If this time is short, FM stereo hiss will be removed nearly immediately
when it becomes present. However, the detection of noise vs. tones and the
level detection is less accurate. With longer times, it takes longer for the
filter to kick in but it has less effect on the sound and removes the FM
hiss a bit more accurately (or actually, the [[317]] setting can be reduced a
bit).
