This feature is also useful for networks which have both &ldquo;regional&rdquo; and &ldquo;local&rdquo; programming fed to the transmitter site from different studio locations, one of which is silent while the other is active. This setting will be disabled if &ldquo;Use as Backup&rdquo; is &ldquo;Off&rdquo;.
