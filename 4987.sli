Limiter attack/release speedup if no bass is detected.

The idea here is that when there's no bass, the limiter can move very fast
without causing intermodulation distortion. If there is a lot of bass,
the limiter needs to move slower.

Slower movements lead to lower output levels, so if the difference is too
big and the limiter is working very hard, bass tends to cause volume
drops.
