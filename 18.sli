Maximum speed at which the filter follows detected phasing errors.

This slider controls how fast the azimuth correction can change if the measured displacement is differs from the correction that is taking place.

Use a very low value (ó 0.1 æm) to correct for a constant azimuth correction.

Use a higher value (~ 0.4 æm) to also correct for rapid changes.

To avoid getting too much effects from measurement noise, use the lowest possible value where the blue line (the actually performed correction) can keep up with the red dots (the measurements).
