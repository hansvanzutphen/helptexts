Use a separate thread for SCA input.

Enable this to avoid hiccups on the main audio if there are differences
in sample rate between the sound cards for [[9051]] and [[10189]].

Only enable this if it's really - if possible use the same sound card
for both inputs. While this checkbox protects the main audio ([[9051]])
from hiccups, the SCA signal may still get hiccups.
