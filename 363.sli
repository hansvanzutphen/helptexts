If tilt cannot be detected, do not declip.

If there's clipping, then there are usually a lot of samples on a line on the
top or bottom of the waveform. And that means that the tilt can be detected.
If nothing like this is present, it makes sense to assume that the audio has
not been clipped, and to turn the declipper off.
