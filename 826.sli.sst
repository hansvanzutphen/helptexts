When bass at the level set by the &ldquo;Clip Threshold&rdquo; control would cause audible IM distortion, it will instead be clipped at the point determined by the &ldquo;Protection Threshold&rdquo; control. Note that if both the &ldquo;Clip Threshold&rdquo; and &ldquo;Protection Threshold&rdquo; controls are set to the same value, the bass clipper will operate in all cases in a &ldquo;fixed threshold&rdquo; traditional manner.
