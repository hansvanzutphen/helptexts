Protects an FM signal thats sent to the transmitter over a lossy link.

See [[10128]]. The same effect can also be used for lossy FM links.
The total amount of pre-emphasis is really big, so this really should
only be used if loudness isn't very important (for example in countries
with loudness limitations, such as BS412).
